# Snazzlles Big Bumper Guide to Useful Software
## Welcome!

This is a list and documentation repository for free, _(mainly)_ open-source software compatible with corporate computers that I've found personally useful as a civil engineer. In order to be as corporate-computer-friendly as possible, almost all of these programs are available as portable (.zip) versions that do not require installation and shouldn't be blocked by admin rights.
