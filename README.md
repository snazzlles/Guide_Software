# Snazzlles Big Bumper Guide to Software
## Welcome to Snazzlles Big Bumper Guide to Software!

This is a list and documentation repository for free, (mainly) open-source software compatible with corporate computers that I've found personally useful as a civil engineer. In order to be as corporate-computer-friendly as possible, most of these programs are available as portable (.zip) versions that do not require installation.
